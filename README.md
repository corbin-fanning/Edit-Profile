This is one part of the Lynk Prototype App I am creating with a team from the Aggies in Tech Program at Texas A&M.
This is the edit profile page for the users of the App. They can edit their name, and get a link to share with friends. 
In the future we are going to implement a profile picture and an Edit Profile Picture button on the app

For the prototype this will implement a JSON file to store the name and Link for the user. In the future the entire app will use Google Firebase for the database.
VVV is the mock-up on figma for what the page will look like in the future.
